To
 
enable
 
remote
 
control
 
of
 
the
 
robot,
 
we
 
implemented
 
an
 
isolated
 
remote
 
machine
 
that
 
serves
 
as
 
a
 
secure
 
environment
 
for
 
executing
 
the
 
control
 
software.
 
This
 
machine
 
operates
 
as
 
a
 
VNC
 
server
 
using
 
TightVNC,
 
providing
 
a
 
remote
 
graphical
 
session
 
without
 
exposing
 
any
 
credentials
 
to
 
end
 
users.
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
ensure
 
system
 
security,
 
we
 
configured
 
network
 
policies
 
to
 
restrict
 
VNC
 
connections
 
exclusively
 
to
 
the
 
Bridge
 
Server
 
[9],
 
preventing
 
any
 
direct
 
or
 
unauthorized
 
access
 
attempts
 
from
 
the
 
internal
 
or
 
external
 
network.
 
 
Furthermore,
 
we
 
created
 
a
 
dedicated
 
user
 
account
 
on
 
this
 
machine
 
with
 
strictly
 
limited
 
privileges
 
to
 
support
 
student
 
access.
 
Since
 
Jupyter
 
Notebook
 
was
 
used
 
to
 
control
 
the
 
robot,
 
we
 
applied
 
additional
 
restrictions
 
using
 
Group
 
Policy
 
Objects
 
(GPOs)
 
to
 
limit
 
access
 
to
 
system-level
 
functionalities
 
and
 
block
 
interaction
 
with
 
critical
 
components
 
of
 
the
 
Windows
 
environment.
 
In
 
addition,
 
we
 
configured
 
Mozilla
 
Firefox
 
in
 
kiosk
 
mode
 
so
 
that
 
students
 
could
 
interact
 
only
 
with
 
the
 
control
 
interface
 
and
 
the
 
files
 
necessary
 
for
 
operating
 
the
 
robot,
 
thus
 
maintaining
 
a
 
secure,
 
controlled,
 
and
 
isolated
 
environment
 
throughout
 
the
 
remote
 
session.
 
 
To
 
control
 
the
 
robot
 
without
 
relying
 
on
 
the
 
proprietary
 
software
 
provided
 
by
 
DOBOT,
 
the
 
TCP/IP
 
interface
 
integrated
 
into
 
the
 
Magician
 
E6
 
was
 
employed.
 
This
 
functionality
 
allows
 
direct
 
communication
 
through
 
sockets,
 
enabling
 
commands
 
documented
 
by
 
the
 
manufacturer
 
to
 
be
 
invoked
 
from
 
Python
 
scripts.
 
This
 
method
 
bypasses
 
the
 
official
 
application
 
to
 
operate
 
directly
 
via
 
the
 
socket
 
interface.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
it
 
significantly
 
reduces
 
computational
 
overhead
 
and
 
facilitates
 
execution
 
in
 
lightweight
 
virtualized
 
environments
 
to
 
optimize
 
resource
 
usage.
 
In
 
the
 
initial
 
development
 
phase,
 
a
 
set
 
of
 
high-level
 
functions
 
was
 
implemented
 
to
 
simplify
 
robot
 
calls
 
for
 
motion
 
commands
 
and
 
state
 
queries.
 
These
 
primitives
 
enabled
 
the
 
creation
 
of
 
automated
 
drag-and-drop
 
sequences,
 
validating
 
the
 
feasibility
 
of
 
the
 
TCP/IP
 
based
 
approach.
 
 
The
 
core
 
of
 
this
 
architecture
 
is
 
the
 
Bridge
 
Server
 
[9],
 
which
 
acts
 
as
 
a
 
secure
 
bridge
 
to
 
the
 
isolated
 
machine
 
on
 
the
 
internal
 
network
 
(Figure
 
x).
 
It
 
is
 
worth
 
noting
 
that
 
this
 
infrastructure
 
is
 
distributed
 
across
 
two
 
campuses
 
connected
 
via
 
VPN,
 
with
 
the
 
server
 
housed
 
in
 
one
 
facility
 
and
 
the
 
physical
 
robot
 
in
 
another.
 
The
 
server
 
validates
 
the
 
legitimacy
 
of
 
the
 
connections
 
through
 
direct
 
queries
 
to
 
the
 
Booking
 
System
 
[8],
 
where
 
the
 
student
 
must
 
first
 
reserve
 
a
 
time
 
slot
 
to
 
obtain
 
a
 
valid
 
access
 
key.
 
This
 
authorization
 
mechanism,
 
based
 
on
 
access
 
keys,
 
ensures
 
that
 
the
 
connections
 
to
 
the
 
remote
 
lab
 
are
 
only
 
enabled
 
strictly
 
during
 
reserved
 
timeframes,
 
delegating
 
access
 
management
 
to
 
the
 
Booking
 
System
 
and
 
eliminating
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
manage
 
credentials
 
on
 
the
 
intermediate
 
server
 
or
 
directly
 
in
 
the
 
VNC.
 
 
The
 
experience
 
is
 
consolidated
 
through
 
a
 
noVNC-based
 
web
 
interface,
 
which
 
integrates
 
remote
 
desktop
 
viewing,
 
video
 
streaming
 
from
 
cameras,
 
and
 
access
 
to
 
a
 
bidirectional
 
file
 
manager.
 
Through
 
this
 
interface,
 
the
 
student
 
can
 
interact
 
with
 
the
 
control
 
software
 
on
 
the
 
isolated
 
machine
 
to
 
upload
 
and
 
run
 
scripts
 
to
 
define
 
the
 
robot’s
 
movement.
